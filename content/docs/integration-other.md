# Other

Detailed instructions for other frameworks/libraries will be added.

The key points are always:

- exclude `shout.wasm.js` from bundling/code-splitting
- set correct [Cross-Origin headers](/docs/prerequisite) for `shout.wasm.js` and `shout.wasm.worker.mjs`

_Pull requests for examples, integrations are welcome_.

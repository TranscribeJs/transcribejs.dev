# Other

Other frameworks/libraries will be added soon.

_Pull requests for examples and/or integration instructions are very welcome_.

The key points are always:

- exclude `shout.wasm.js` from bundling/code-splitting
- set correct [Cross-Origin headers](/docs/prerequisite) for `shout.wasm.js` and `shout.wasm.worker.mjs`
